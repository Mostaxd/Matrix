// tried to seperate member function initialization from class declaration
// compiler throws bunch of errors if declaration part is pasted here
// asking yourself what's the purpose of this file then?
// answer: compatibility with Makefile and as friendly reminder that we should
// have splitted it at creation :)

// never mind -- after some research i found - it's not possible to put templates in .cpp files

#include "Matrix.h"
